/** Implements a 'smart' computer player according to the scheme described here: https://arstechnica.com/science/2014/05/win-at-rock-paper-scissors-by-knowing-thy-opponent/
    If the last game was a tie or this is the first game, then choose a random symbol.
    If it lost the last game, then it will assume the opponent will repeat its strategy. Hence it will choose the symbol for the coming game that would have made it win the previous game.
    If it won the last game, then play the hand that your opponent last played. */
